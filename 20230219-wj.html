<section id="mettl3-controls-tfh-differentiation-and-gc-reactions." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mettl3-controls-tfh-differentiation-and-gc-reactions.">2.1 <em>METTL3</em> controls Tfh differentiation and GC reactions.</h4>
<p>1)the function of T-bet? Why authors detect this protein here?</p>
<p class="blue">This gene is a member of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box. T-box genes encode transcription factors involved in the regulation of developmental processes. This gene is the human ortholog of mouse Tbx21/Tbet gene. Studies in mouse show that Tbx21 protein is a Th1 cell-specific transcription factor that controls the expression of the hallmark Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFNG). Expression of the human ortholog also correlates with IFNG expression in Th1 and natural killer cells, suggesting a role for this gene in initiating Th1 lineage development from naive Th precursor cells(<a href="https://www.genecards.org/" class="uri">https://www.genecards.org/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">The authors detected T-bet protein expression to compare its levels in both TH1 and TFH cells and aimed to confirm the prediction that T-bet is expressed at a relatively high level on the TH1 lineage, as previously known. They also investigated whether TH1 cells downregulated T-bet expression in the absence of METTL3 (as indicated in Fig. 1B, where the number of TH1 cells was reduced in the absence of METTL3).</p>
<p>2)the meaning of CXCR5, PD-1, ICOS, Bcl-6? What role they play in Tfh cell differentiation?</p>
<p class="blue">These are all markers of Tfh cells. Bcl-6 is a major transcription factor in Tfh cells that promotes the expression of T(FH)-related genes while inhibiting the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2, and T(H)17 cells(<span class="citation" data-cites="Nurieva2009a">Nurieva et al. (<a href="#ref-Nurieva2009a" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>).</p>
<p class="blue">CXCR5 is a cytokine receptor that binds to B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC) and is involved in the migration of B-cells into B-cell follicles of the spleen and Peyer patches. ICOS belongs to the CD28 and CTLA-4 cell-surface receptor family and is essential for efficient interaction between T and B-cells, as well as for normal antibody responses to T-cell dependent antigens(<a href="https://www.genecards.org/" class="uri">https://www.genecards.org/</a>). PD-1 is an immune-inhibitory receptor expressed in activated T cells that also plays an important role in Tfh positioning and function(<span class="citation" data-cites="Shi2018">Shi et al. (<a href="#ref-Shi2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>).</p>
<p class="blue">Therefore, I believe the authors want to use the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of these markers to confirm whether the cells they are studying have more Tfh-associated surface proteins than other cell types.</p>
<p>3)Why did the authors do some analysis of GL-7+Fas+, IgDlowCD138+ and PNA+Fas+?</p>
<p class="blue">GL-7, Fas, and PNA are markers commonly used to identify different stages of B cell development and maturation. IgDlowCD138 is a marker of plasma cell differentiation. GL-7 and Fas are often used to identify germinal center B cells, which are activated B cells that undergo rapid proliferation, somatic hypermutation, and selection for high-affinity antibodies. PNA is a lectin that binds to glycoproteins on the surface of germinal center B cells and is commonly used as a marker of germinal center formation. IgDlowCD138, on the other hand, is a marker of plasma cells, which are the terminally differentiated form of B cells that produce and secrete large amounts of antibodies. By analyzing the expression of these markers, researchers can gain insight into the dynamics of B cell activation, differentiation, and maturation in response to various stimuli such as pathogens, vaccines, or drugs(<span class="citation" data-cites="Naito2007">Naito et al. (<a href="#ref-Naito2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="Hao2008">Hao et al. (<a href="#ref-Hao2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>; <a href="https://www.genecards.org/" class="uri">https://www.genecards.org/</a>).</p>
<p>4)Why did the authors analyze GATA3+CD44+CD4+T cells, RORγt+CD44+CD4+T cells Foxp3+CD44+CD4+T cells, IL-4-producing CD4+T cells and IL-17a-producing CD4+T cells？</p>
<p class="blue">The authors analyzed GATA3+CD44+CD4+ T cells, RORγt+CD44+CD4+ T cells, Foxp3+CD44+CD4+ T cells, IL-4-producing CD4+ T cells, and IL-17a-producing CD4+ T cells to investigate the effects of METTL3 depletion on different subsets of CD4+ T cells. GATA3 and RORγt are transcription factors that are associated with T helper cell differentiation into Th2 and Th17 cells, respectively. Foxp3 is a transcription factor associated with regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have an immunosuppressive role in the immune system. IL-4 and IL-17a are cytokines produced by Th2 and Th17 cells, respectively, and are involved in various immune responses. By analyzing these markers, the authors aimed to determine whether the absence of METTL3 affected the differentiation and function of these different subsets of CD4+ T cells(fig.1).</p>
<p>5)what is causing the difference in the y-axis values between (fig.1A-B) and (fig.2a-b)?</p>
<p class="blue">Actually, the authors utilized two distinct antigens in their study: the LCMV-Armstrong strain(fig.1A-B) and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)(fig.2a-b).</p>
<p class="blue">Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is a copper-containing protein that is large and complex in structure. It is obtained from the hemolymph of the giant keyhole limpet, Megathura crenulata. KLH has been widely utilized as an immunogen to activate the immune system in various therapeutic applications, such as cancer immunotherapy, allergy treatment, and autoimmune disease therapy. Furthermore, KLH has also been an essential tool in basic research to investigate the immune system and to develop novel vaccines. Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) is an oil-in-water emulsion that is commonly used in immunology research to enhance the immune response to antigens(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p>6)why did the authors think <em>METTL3</em> controls GC reactions?</p>
<p class="blue">The process of the GC (germinal center) reaction can be broken down into several stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="blue">Antigen presentation: The GC reaction is triggered by the presentation of antigens to B cells by dendritic cells. Antigens are typically derived from pathogens, but can also be self-antigens in the case of autoimmune diseases.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">B cell activation and proliferation: Upon encountering antigens, B cells become activated and start to proliferate rapidly, forming a primary focus. B cells are also aided by helper T cells, which provide additional signals to drive their proliferation and differentiation.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Formation of the dark zone: Within the primary focus, B cells start to migrate and form two distinct zones - a dark zone and a light zone. In the dark zone, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, a process that introduces random mutations into the genes encoding the antibody variable regions. B cells also undergo class switching, a process that changes the isotype of the antibodies produced.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Selection in the light zone: In the light zone, B cells interact with specialized stromal cells and receive signals that help to refine their antigen specificity. B cells with higher-affinity receptors are selected for survival and undergo further rounds of proliferation, while those with lower-affinity receptors undergo apoptosis.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Differentiation: B cells that survive the selection process exit the GC and differentiate into either plasma cells, which produce and secrete large amounts of antibody, or memory B cells, which can quickly respond to subsequent infections with the same pathogen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="blue">The GC reaction is a highly regulated process that ensures the production of high-affinity antibodies against a wide range of pathogens. However, dysregulation of the GC reaction can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases or lymphomas, making it an important target for therapeutic interventions(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">The authors conducted three independent experiments in a mouse model injected with LCMV-Armstrong strain. They observed a reduction in the number of GL-7+Fas+ GC B cells, IgDlowCD138+ PC and PNA+Fas+ GC B cells in the flow cytometry analysis, a decrease in IgG levels by ELISA test, and differences in the GC structure in IF in the absence of METTL3. In another experiment, the authors injected KLH(CFA) into mice and found a reduction in the number of IgDlowCD138+ PC and PNA+Fas+ GC B cells in the flow cytometry analysis in the absence of METTL3. So, the authors believe <em>METTL3</em> controls GC reactions.</p>

<section id="mettl3-intrinsically-regulates-tfh-differentiation." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mettl3-intrinsically-regulates-tfh-differentiation.">2.2 <em>METTL3</em> intrinsically regulates Tfh differentiation.</h4>
<p>1)Why do the authors designed the two animal model?</p>
<p class="blue">Bone marrow chimeric mice are a type of mouse model that is generated by transplanting bone marrow cells from one mouse into another mouse that has been irradiated or treated with chemotherapy to eliminate its own bone marrow cells. This results in the engraftment of the transplanted bone marrow cells and the reconstitution of the recipient mouse’s hematopoietic system with cells derived from the donor mouse. In the study, the authors generated bone marrow chimeric mice in which only the hematopoietic cells (including T cells) expressed or lacked METTL3. By comparing Tfh cell differentiation in these mice, the authors were able to determine that METTL3 expression in T cells themselves is required for proper Tfh cell differentiation. This approach allowed the authors to investigate the intrinsic role of METTL3 in Tfh cell differentiation, independent of any potential effects of METTL3 expression in other cell types. Overall, bone marrow chimeric mice are a useful tool for investigating the function of specific cell types or genes in complex biological processes, such as immune cell differentiation(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>

<section id="mettl3-is-essential-for-the-early-initiation-of-tfh-cells." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mettl3-is-essential-for-the-early-initiation-of-tfh-cells.">2.3 <em>METTL3</em> is essential for the early initiation of Tfh cells.</h4>
<p>1)the meaning of markers(CD69, CD44, CD62L, CD25)? function? Why have the markers not been changed in the absence of METTL3?</p>
<p class="blue">In the “METTL3 is essential for the early initiation of Tfh cells” section of the article “METTL3-dependent m6A modification programs T follicular helper cell differentiation”, the authors used various cell surface markers, including CD69, CD44, CD62L, and CD25, to analyze the early stages of T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation. CD69 is a cell surface marker that is upregulated upon T cell activation and is often used as a marker of recent T cell activation. CD44 is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed by activated T cells and is associated with effector function. CD62L is a cell surface molecule that is important for T cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs. CD25 is a subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor that is upregulated upon T cell activation. In the study, the authors analyzed the expression of these markers on T cells during the early stages of Tfh cell differentiation, both in the presence and absence of METTL3. The results showed that METTL3-deficient T cells had impaired upregulation of CD69, CD44, and CD62L, indicating that METTL3 is required for the early activation and migration of T cells to the germinal center. Overall, the use of these cell surface markers provides a way to track the early stages of Tfh cell differentiation and to understand the role of specific genes, such as METTL3, in this process(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">The authors showed that METTL3 is essential for the early initiation of Tfh cells, and that METTL3-deficient T cells had impaired upregulation of certain cell surface markers, including CD69, CD44, and CD62L, during the early stages of Tfh cell differentiation. However, the levels of these markers were not completely absent in METTL3-deficient T cells. One possible explanation for this observation is that the upregulation of these markers is regulated by multiple signaling pathways and mechanisms, and that METTL3 is just one of the factors that contribute to their expression. In the absence of METTL3, other factors may partially compensate for its loss, resulting in some residual upregulation of these markers. Another possible explanation is that the absence of METTL3 may affect the kinetics or magnitude of the upregulation of these markers, rather than completely blocking their expression. This could lead to delayed or weaker upregulation of these markers in the absence of METTL3, but not complete downregulation. Overall, while the exact mechanisms underlying the partial upregulation of these markers in the absence of METTL3 are not yet fully understood, the study suggests that METTL3 plays an important role in the early initiation of Tfh cells and the upregulation of these markers during Tfh cell differentiation.</p>
<p>2)The introduction of TCF-1(<em>tcf7</em>)?</p>
<p class="blue">TCF-7 (also known as TCF-1) is a transcription factor protein that belongs to the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors. TCF-7 plays an important role in T cell development and differentiation, as well as in the maintenance of T cell identity. In T cells, TCF-7 is required for the development of thymocytes into mature T cells, as well as for the differentiation of T cell subsets, including T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. TCF-7 regulates the expression of genes that are important for T cell development and function, including genes involved in T cell receptor signaling and cytokine production(<a href="https://www.genecards.org/" class="uri">https://www.genecards.org/</a>).</p>
<p>3)The introduction of Caspase-3?</p>
<p class="blue">Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease protein that plays a critical role in the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. It is a member of the caspase family of proteins, which are a group of cysteine proteases that are involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and cell proliferation(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">Caspase-3 is activated during the execution phase of apoptosis, which is the final stage of the apoptotic process. Caspase-3 is responsible for cleaving many of the cellular proteins that are necessary for maintaining cell structure and function, including cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear proteins, and enzymes. By cleaving these proteins, caspase-3 triggers the breakdown of the cell and the removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, preventing the release of harmful cellular contents into the surrounding tissue(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">Caspase-3 is activated by upstream caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9, which are themselves activated by various intracellular and extracellular signals. The activation of caspase-3 is tightly regulated by a variety of factors, including the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, as well as by various signaling pathways that are activated in response to cellular stress, DNA damage, or other stimuli(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">Caspase-3 has been implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including tissue development, immune system regulation, and cancer. Dysregulation of caspase-3 activity has been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. As such, caspase-3 is a target of therapeutic agents that are aimed at modulating apoptosis in various disease states(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p>4)Why did the authors do some q-PCR verification of <em>Tcf7, CXCR5, Bcl6, pdcd1, Icos, Prdm1, Id2</em>?</p>
<p class="blue">Tcf7, CXCR5, Bcl6, pdcd1, Icos, Prdm1, and Id2 are genes that play important roles in the development and function of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="blue">Tcf7 (also known as Tcf1) is a transcription factor that is involved in regulating T cell differentiation and survival. In the context of Tfh cells, Tcf7 has been shown to promote early Tfh differentiation and to be required for Tfh cell maintenance.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">CXCR5 is a chemokine receptor that is critical for Tfh cell migration and localization within B cell follicles. CXCR5 is upregulated in developing Tfh cells and promotes their migration to the follicular zone.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Bcl6 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a key role in Tfh differentiation and function. Bcl6 is upregulated in developing Tfh cells and promotes their differentiation and survival.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Pdcd1 (also known as PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor that is upregulated in Tfh cells and is involved in regulating T cell activation and differentiation. Pdcd1 is important for the ability of Tfh cells to provide help to B cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Icos (also known as ICOS or CD278) is a co-stimulatory receptor that is upregulated in developing Tfh cells and is required for their differentiation and function. Icos promotes Tfh cell survival and cytokine production.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Prdm1 (also known as Blimp-1) is a transcription factor that is involved in regulating the differentiation and function of various immune cell types. In Tfh cells, Prdm1 is a negative regulator of Tfh differentiation and function and promotes the formation of non-Tfh cell subsets.</p></li>
<li><p class="blue">Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) is a transcriptional regulator that is important for the development of various immune cell types, including Tfh cells. Id2 is upregulated in developing Tfh cells and promotes their differentiation and survival.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="blue">Together, these genes play important roles in the development and function of Tfh cells, which are specialized T cells that provide help to B cells during the process of antibody production(<a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat/" class="uri">https://chat.openai.com/chat/</a>).</p>
<p class="blue">The authors performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) verification of Tcf7, CXCR5, Bcl6, pdcd1, Icos, Prdm1, and Id2 in order to confirm the role of METTL3 in the early initiation of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Furthermore, the qPCR data allowed the authors to investigate the potential downstream targets of METTL3 in developing Tfh cells, as well as the molecular pathways that are involved in Tfh differentiation. The upregulation and downregulation of these genes in developing Tfh cells is known to be critical for Tfh differentiation and function, and the qPCR data provided additional evidence for the role of METTL3 in regulating these key Tfh genes. Overall, the qPCR verification provids a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the early initiation of Tfh cells.</p>
